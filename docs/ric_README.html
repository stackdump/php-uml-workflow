This archive contains a sample module named 'CMS_Workflow' organized using the zend package naming schema.
It relies on several other proprietary libraries that are not included (and hence will not work).

Author's Note:
  This module was created in conjunction with another project. Not much time was spent refactoring for efficiency.
  If time permitted, I would have finished updating the Workflow object to allow it to be serialized and then woken up 
  and/or actually generate a php file to instantiate a workflow rather than parsing the *.uml file. 
  I'd also choose to replace the current Cms_Workflow_Config class to read the xml using Domxpath.

Purpose:
  The main purpose of this project was to develop a generic event-driven workflow library controlled from a single config file.
  This allows for the documentation, sequence control, and guard logic to be maintained in a single file modified by a UML editor.

Subdirectories:
  /code - php source code from which the documentation is generated
  /data - sample .uml files containing workflow diagrams
  /docs - the phpDocumentor generated files

UML Files:
  The included samples were created using: ArogoUML v 0.28
